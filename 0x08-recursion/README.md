# 0x08-recursion

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the concept of recursion.

## Files

* [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion): C program that prints a string using recursion.
* [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion): C program that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
* [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion): C program that calculates the length of a string using recursion.
* [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial): C program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
* [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion): C program that calculates the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.
* [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion): C program that calculates the natural square root of a number using recursion.
* [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number): C program that checks if a number is prime using recursion.
* [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome): C program that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
* [101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp): C program that compares two strings and checks if they can be considered identical, with support for the special character *.

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
* All programs should end with a new line
* The code should use the Betty style and pass the betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl checks
* No global variables are allowed
* Each function should be limited to a maximum of 25 lines
* Each file can contain a maximum of 5 functions

## Compilation

The programs can be compiled using the following command:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file-name>.c -o <output-file>

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
	git clone https://github.com/udeme-goc/alx-low_level_programming.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	cd 0x08-recursion
3. Compile the source files:
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o output
4. Run the executable:
	./<output-file>
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program.
