## Description

This project contains a collection of C functions that demonstrate memory allocation and deallocation using the `malloc` and `free` functions. Each function performs a specific task related to memory management, such as duplicating a string, concatenating strings, allocating a 2D grid, freeing a 2D grid, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `0-strdup.c`: A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
- `1-str_concat.c`: A function that concatenates two strings and returns a new string containing the concatenated result.
- `2-alloc_grid.c`: A function that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers, with each element initialized to 0.
- `3-free_grid.c`: A function that frees the memory allocated for a 2-dimensional grid.
- `100-argstostr.c`: A function that concatenates all the arguments of the program into a single string.
- `101-strtow.c`: A function that splits a string into words and returns an array of strings.

## Compilation

The code should be compiled using the following flags:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89


## Usage

To use any of the functions in this project, include the corresponding header file in your program and call the function as needed.
