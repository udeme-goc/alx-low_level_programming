## Description
This repository contains a series of Makefile tasks for the 0x1C project in the C programming language. The tasks involve creating, understanding, and using Makefiles to compile C programs efficiently.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several Makefile tasks, each focusing on different aspects of Makefile usage. The tasks include:

1. **0-Makefile:** Create your first Makefile.
2. **1-Makefile:** Create a Makefile with specified rules and variables.
3. **2-Makefile:** Create a more useful Makefile with additional variables.
4. **3-Makefile:** Enhance the Makefile with additional rules (clean, oclean, fclean, re).
5. **4-Makefile:** Create a complete Makefile with more advanced features.
6. **5-island_perimeter.py:** Python script for calculating the perimeter of an island.

## Instructions for Each Makefile Task
- **0-Makefile:** Run `make -f 0-Makefile`.
- **1-Makefile:** Run `make -f 1-Makefile`.
- **2-Makefile:** Run `make -f 2-Makefile`.
- **3-Makefile:** Run `make -f 3-Makefile`.
- **4-Makefile:** Run `make -f 4-Makefile`.
- **5-island_perimeter.py:** Python script usage example.

## Requirements
- Compiler: gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Make: GNU Make 4.2.1

## Notes
- Ensure that the source files (main.c, school.c, m.h) are in the same directory as the Makefiles.
- Follow the specified instructions for each Makefile task.
